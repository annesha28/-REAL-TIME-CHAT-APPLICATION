This project is a real-time chat application developed using WebSockets and core web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without relying on any front-end frameworks or libraries. The aim of this project is to provide a lightweight, responsive, and interactive messaging interface that allows multiple users to exchange messages in real time.

The frontend is built with pure HTML, styled using CSS for responsiveness and a clean UI, and uses vanilla JavaScript to handle WebSocket connections and dynamic message updates. The backend is implemented using Node.js with the built-in ws WebSocket library to handle multiple client connections and broadcast messages between them.
